# InfoHazard

The tools to be free.

## About

This is a collection of tools designed to be physible or otherwise easily
manufactured and knowledge spanning a broad range of useful topics. It is meant
to be an offline resource for resistance, revolution, or insurrection. This will
contain both designs I create myself and the technical data and theory necessary
to design your own.

## Building

To build the repo in linux: 

1. download a copy
2. extract it
3. navigate to the directory in a command line
4. 'python3 -m venv venv'
5. 'source venv/bin/activate'
6. 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
7. 'mkdocs build'
8. this will create a directory called site containing a build of the wiki
